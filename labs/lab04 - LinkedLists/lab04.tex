\section{Pre-Lab}

This week, you will be writing a generic Linked List data structure in Java. Your summary:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Download the starter code and import the project into Eclipse
	\item Implement the LinkedList.java class
	\item Verify your implementation using the provided tester class
	\item \textbf{FILES TO DOWNLOAD:} linkedLists.zip
	\item \textbf{FILES TO SUBMIT:} LinkedList.java
\end{enumerate}

%------------------------------------------------

\subsection{LinkedList.java}

Once you've imported the provided code into Eclipse, your first task is to implement LinkedList.java. This class will implement the provided List interface, which is duplicated for your convenience here. Your task is to implement each of these methods.

\begin{lstlisting}
public interface List<T> {
	
	/**
	 * Returns the size of this list, i.e., the number of nodes currently between the head and tail
	 * @return
	 */
	public int size();
	
	/**
	 * Clears out the entire list
	 */
	public void clear() ;
	
	/**
	 * Inserts new data at the end of the list (i.e., just before the dummy tail node)
	 * @param data
	 */
	public void insertAtTail(T data);
	
	/**
	 * Inserts data at the front of the list (i.e., just after the dummy head node
	 * @param data
	 */
	public void insertAtHead(T data);
	
	/**
	 * Inserts node such that index becomes the position of the newly inserted data
	 * @param data
	 * @param index
	 */
	public void insertAt(int index, T data);
	
	public T removeAtTail();
	
	public T removeAtHead();
	
	/**
	 * Returns index of first occurrence of the data in the list, or -1 if not present
	 * @param data
	 * @return
	 */
	public int find(T data);
	
	/**
	 * Returns the data at the given index, null if anything goes wrong (index out of bounds, empty list, etc.)
	 * @param index
	 * @return
	 */
	public T get(int index);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Testing Your Implementation}

\section{In-Lab}

The goal of this in-lab is to practice doing object oriented code design. The TA will lead you through these exercises.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Get into small groups of two
	\item The TAs will present you with some programming challenges. These will not be graded, but you are required to attend and to participate.
	\item You may think about the challenges before lab below if you'd like, but we highly recommend that you not solve them ahead of time.
	\item The TAs will give you time to solve each problem and lead you in sharing solutions with one another.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Object Oriented Code Design}

One skill that employers are interested in is object oriented code design. That is, given a set of requirements, how might you structure the classes, fields, and methods within your code to model that situation. For the following scenarios, list out the classes that you would likely write. In addition, for each class write out the fields and methods contained within. Describe how each class relates to one another as well.

You will do this exercise for the following scenarios.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item You are designing a system that handles flight bookings for customers. Design a set of objects / classes / methods / fields to model this situation. Some of the requirements include:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A flight has a starting airport, a destination airport, a capacity, a price and possibly other features.
		\item The system needs to handle searching for flights, purchasing flights, viewing booked upcoming flights, etc.
		\item The system needs to support user accounts, logins, purchasing information, etc.
		\item Feel free to make other assumptions about useful features as long as you can justify your decisions.
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Design some object oriented code that supports a ride sharing service such as Uber or Lyft. Some requirements:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item There are driver accounts and rider accounts (some folks might be both)
		\item A user can enter payment info
		\item A user can request rides, a driver can accept rides (or can they? Should they have a choice? You design it.)
		\item A user's fare needs to be calculated depending on various factors.
		\item A driver can deliver food from local restaurants for people if they'd like to.
		\item Include all features you can think of from using these services yourself.
		\item Feel free to make other assumptions about useful features as long as you can justify your decisions.
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Design an object oriented codebase for SIS. Don't forget the following:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item You need to account for different user types (e.g., student, professor, admin, etc.)
		\item Students should not be able to accomplish professor tasks and vice versa.
		\item Remember that SIS also handles things such as grade entry, advisor relationships / advisor holds, etc.
		\item As before, feel free to make other assumptions as long as you can justify those decisions.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\newpage
\section{Post-Lab}

The goal of this post-lab is to write a report comparing two distinct strategies for your blackjack player. The requirements for this post-lab are VERY simular to last week. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Construct at least two distinct strategies for player. 
	\item Run an experiment comparing how well each strategy plays blackjack.
	\item Write a report summarizing and analyzing your findings.
	\item \textbf{FILES TO DOWNLOAD:} None
	\item \textbf{FILES TO SUBMIT:} PostLabThree.pdf
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Performing an Experiment}

Your first task is to write (if you haven't already) \textbf{two unique} blackjack players that incorporate different strategies. You should be able to argue that the two strategies are significantly different AND that it is not obvious to you which is better. You should be geniuinely curious which approach will succeed.

You should then do the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Run each of your two players for 10000 hands in the simulator. Run this simulation 10 times, and calculate the average and standard deviation of the results.
	\item Which bot does better? Why do you think this is? Does one have a higher average but also higher standard deviation? If so, why?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Report}

Summarize your experiment and your findings in a report. Make sure to adhere to these general guidelines:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Your submission MUST BE a pdf document. You will receive a zero if it is not.
	\item Your document MUST be presented as if submitted to a professional publication outlet. You can use the \href{https://github.com/markfloryan/dsa1}{template} posted in the course repository or follow \href{https://www.springer.com/us/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines}{Springer's guidelines for conference proceedings}.
	\item You should write your report as if it is original novel research.
	\item The grammar / spelling / professionalism of this document should be sound.
	\item When possible, do not use the first person. Instead of "I ran the code 60 times", use "The code was executed 60 times...".
\end{itemize}

In addition to the general guidelines above, please follow the following rough outline for your paper:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Abstract}: Summarize the entire document in a single paragraph
	\item \textbf{Introduction}: Present the problem, and provide details regarding the two strategies you implemented.
	\item \textbf{Methods}: Describe your methodology for collecting data. How many hands, how many executions, how you averaged things, etc.
	\item \textbf{Results}: Describe your results from your execution runs.
	\item \textbf{Conclusion}: Interpret your results. Which strategy was better? Why was it better? Were you surprised? Was one strategy better in some situations and not in others? Why do you think that is? Notice that I'm not looking for a particular answer here. Show me that you can interpret what happened when you ran your code.
\end{itemize}

Lastly, your paper MUST contain the following things:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A table (methods section) summarizing the different experimental groups and how many execution runs were done in each group.
	\item A table (results section) summarizing each experimental group and the averages / std. dev. for each (as well as any other data you decided to collect).
	\item Some kind of graph visualizing the results of the table from the previous bullet.
\end{itemize}
