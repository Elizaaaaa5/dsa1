CS2501 - Data Structures and Algorithms I Due Dates
===============================

[Main Logistics Page](index.html) ([md](index.md))

All the assignments in this course consist of lab assignments. The pre-lab and post-lab sections all have deliverables, while the in-lab assignments are grading on attendance and participation only. Thus, students do not need to submit anything on Collab for in-labs. All other assignments will be submitted on Collab. Each assignment has:

- __Open Date__: The earliest the assignment may be submitted.
- __Due Date__: The expected due date
- __Close Date__: The absolute last time in which the assignment may be submitted for any credit.

Any late lab will incur a 25% off per 24 hour penalty. The labs generally close 48 hours after the due date, so a maximum penalty of 50% can be incurred before the lab closes. This is because the TAs need to start grading the submissions at that time.

Below are the dates when the various assignment *submissions* for the lab parts open, are due, and close.

| Lab part | | Open date          	| | Due date               | | Close date                 |
